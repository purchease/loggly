  # THIS IS THE ENDPOINT URL FOR LOGGLY
  #

  # Contructing a full URL. It has the endpoint + the token we generate at:
  # https://venuedriver.loggly.com/inputs
  #
  def self.url
    @@endpoint + self.token
  end

  def self.token
    # Add the token in the subclasses.
    # This method must return a string
    # The idea is to have a subclass for each of the inputs that we create in loggly
    # URL to get the token from: https://venuedriver.loggly.com/inputs
  end


  # Public
  # This method sends a message to the Loggly API.
  #
  #
  # BEAWARE: That Loggle.new is an abstract class and lacks the token to authenticate with loggly.
  # You should subclass loggly and add a method named token that returns a string with the appropiate token.
  # SEE the method token on this class to know more about it
  #
  # EXAMPLES
  # USAGE: Let's say you have a class named TicketLoggly that subclasses Loggly.
  #
  # TicketLoggly.record("This works")
  #
  # You can also send a timestamp. For example:
  #
  # TicketLoggly.record("With a Timestamp", Time.now)
  #
  # Or you can get creative like:
  #
  # TicketLoggly.record(Event.last.attributes.to_json ,Time.now )

  def self.record(message, time=nil)
    self.send_to_loggly(message, time)
  end

  # Public
  #
  # This method behaves the same as record, but uses resque to send the message.
  #
  def self.async_record(message, time=nil, queue_name=:loggly)

    begin
      Resque.enqueue(LogglyResque, self.name, message, time, queue_name)
    rescue => e
      puts e
      puts "There was an error cueing loggly"
    end
  end

  # Private
  #  We use this method internally to send messages to loggly.
  #  It is used by the Resque worker and by the record method.
